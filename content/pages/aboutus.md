  - sectionTitle: Vedanta Movement in America
    sectionContent: The history of the Vedanta movement in America goes back to the
      time of the Chicago World's Parliament of Religions, held in conjunction
      with the Columbian Exposition of 1893. At that time Swami Vivekananda,
      foremost disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, was invited as the Hindu delegate.
      America's response to his heroic Chicago Addresses at the 1893 Parliament
      of Religions is legendary. From that time onward, Swami Vivekananda
      lectured throughout the country and founded two Vedanta Societies — one in
      New York and another in San Francisco – and laid the groundwork for more
      American Vedanta centers to follow.

    sectionContent: The Vedanta movement in the Dallas-Fort Worth area began in the
      1960s, when monks of the Ramakrishna Order first visited the area. Many of
      these swamis came from Vedanta Societies in America, but others came from
      abroad – India, Africa, and Europe to name a few places. The initial
      audiences in Dallas were a mix – local residents and a few immigrants or
      students from India. Meetings were usually held in churches or
      universities, and the guest swamis lectured on Vedanta's relevance as a
      rational, practical philosophy for conducting one's spiritual and
      day-to-day life. Some of the early swamis were Swami Ranganathananda,
      former President of the Ramakrishna Order of India, Swami Bhashyananda,
      Minister of the Chicago Vedanta Society, and Swami Nihshreyasananda from
      Rhodesia.

      The Irving location is convenient for the Dallas-Fort Worth-area devotees
      and is also near the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. So on March 3, 2007 – in
      the presence of over a hundred devotees – Swami Swahananda inaugurated the
      monastery and chapel of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society of North Texas, at
      119 W. Scotland Drive, in Irving, Texas. Swami Sarvadevananda performed
      the consecration ceremony.



      And so, the history of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society of North Texas remains a work in progress and a work towards progress, both individual and collective, in spiritual and social advancement.
