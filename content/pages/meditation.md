    Raja Yoga, often called the "royal path," is the yoga of meditation and mental
    control. The term comes from "raja" meaning king or royal, suggesting it is the
    supreme yoga that governs the mind.



    The classical text of Raja Yoga is Patanjali''s Yoga Sutras, which outlines an
    eight-fold path (Ashtanga Yoga) for achieving mental clarity and spiritual realization:





    1. Yama (Ethical Restraints)

    Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-possessiveness.





    2. Niyama (Observances)

    Purity, contentment, austerity, self-study, and surrender to God.





    3. Asana (Posture)

    A steady and comfortable sitting position for meditation.





    4. Pranayama (Breath Control)

    Regulation of breath to control vital energy and calm the mind.





    5. Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal)

    Withdrawing the senses from external objects to focus inward.





    6. Dharana (Concentration)

    Focusing the mind on a single point or object.





    7. Dhyana (Meditation)

    Sustained, uninterrupted flow of concentration.





    8. Samadhi (Absorption)

    Complete absorption in the object of meditation, leading to self-realization.





    Our weekly study circle explores these principles through reading, discussion,
    and guided practice.'
