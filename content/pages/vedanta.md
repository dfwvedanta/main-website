    A closer look at the word "Vedanta" is revealing: "Vedanta" is a combination of
    two words: "Veda" which means "knowledge" and "anta" which means "the end of"
    or "the goal of." In this context the goal of knowledge isn''t intellectual—the
    limited knowledge we acquire by reading books. "Knowledge" here means the knowledge
    of God as well as the knowledge of our own divine nature. Vedanta, then, is the
    search for Self-knowledge as well as the search for God.'

## Unity in Diversity

The conflicting messages we find among religions are due more to doctrine and dogma than to the reality of spiritual experience. While dissimilarities exist in the external observances of the world religions, the internals bear remarkable similarities.


Vedanta recognizes that different people have different temperaments and inclinations, and therefore require different paths to reach the same ultimate goal. All paths lead to the same summit, though some may be steeper and others more gradual. What matters is not which path one follows, but the sincerity and devotion with which one pursues it.
