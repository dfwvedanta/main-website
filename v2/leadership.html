                        The Ramakrishna Order, formally known as the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, was founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda following the teachings of his master, Sri Ramakrishna. It is one of the largest and most influential monastic orders in modern Hinduism, operating centers worldwide dedicated to spiritual practice, education, and humanitarian service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monks and nuns of the Order take the traditional sannyasa vows of renunciation, dedicating their lives to the twin ideals of spiritual realization and selfless service to humanity. Following Sri Ramakrishna's teaching that "service to man is service to God," the Order operates hospitals, schools, colleges, relief centers, and spiritual centers across the globe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The spiritual leaders who guide our society belong to this ancient tradition of monasticism, combining deep spiritual practice with active engagement in teaching and service. Their training typically includes years of study of Vedantic scriptures, meditation practice, and service in various capacities before being posted to lead Vedanta centers in different parts of the world.
